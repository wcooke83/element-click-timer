## Installation

This extension uses Manifest V2 for broad compatibility across browsers. Follow the steps below to load it as an unpacked/temporary extension for development or testing.

### For Chrome (or Chromium-based browsers like Edge)
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Google Chrome (version 88+) or Microsoft Edge installed.
2. **Load the Extension**:

   - Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner).
   - Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder containing the extension files (e.g., where `manifest.json` is located).
   - The extension icon should appear in your toolbar.
3. **Permissions**: The extension requests `tabs`, `storage`, `notifications`, `activeTab`, and `<all_urls>` for tab management, data persistence, and cross-site functionality.
4. **Updates**: To update, click **Load unpacked** again after modifying files. The browser will reload the extension.

### For Firefox
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Mozilla Firefox (version 78+) installed.

   - Select `manifest.json` from your extension folder.
   - The extension will load temporarily (persists until browser restart).
3. **Permissions**: Same as Chrome‚ÄîFirefox will prompt for permissions on first use.
4. **Updates**: Reload by clicking **Load Temporary Add-on** again after changes. For permanent installation, package as a .xpi (via `about:debugging` > "Package Extension") and sign via Mozilla's Add-ons Developer Hub.

**Note**: In both browsers, test by pinning the extension icon and opening the popup on a webpage.

  - Failure: "Element Not Found: Could not find [element type] on [Page]"
  - Cancelled: "Timer Cancelled: [Reason]"
- Configure notification preferences in Settings

### Example Workflows

#### Automated Form Filling
- On a login page, create two timers:
  1. Enter text into `input#username` at 14:30 (fires at 14:35)
  2. Enter text into `input#password` at 14:30 (fires at 14:35)
  3. Mark password as sensitive data
  4. Set typing speed to 100ms for realistic typing

#### Automated Button Clicking
- On a shopping site, set a timer to click "Add to Cart" (`button.add-to-cart`) at 14:30
- If you navigate away, choose to re-navigate back automatically
- Monitor progress in the popup; get notified when it clicks

#### Bulk Text Entry
- Create multiple timers with different selectors
- Use the "Append" mode to add text without clearing existing content
- Set different target times to stagger the entries

## Development

### Data Structures

#### Timer Object
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  eventType: "click" | "enterText",
  textToEnter: string,              // Empty for click events
  clearBeforeTyping: boolean,       // For enterText only
  isSensitive: boolean,             // Auto-detected or manually marked
  tabId: number,
  tabTitle: string,
  originalUrl: string,
  cssSelector: string,
  targetTime: number,
  selectedTime: number,
  persistence: "session" | "tab" | "browser",
  urlBehavior: "cancel" | "new-tab" | "navigate",
  status: "pending" | "executed-success" | "executed-failure",
  createdAt: number,
  executedAt: number                // Timestamp of execution
}
```

#### Settings Object
```javascript
{
  typingSpeed: number,              // 1-1000ms
  postTextEntryDelay: number,       // 0-5000ms
  triggerFocusBlur: boolean,

  defaultUrlBehavior: string,       // "cancel", "new-tab", or "navigate"
  timerListView: string,            // "detailed" or "compact"
  theme: string                     // "light", "dark", or "system"
}
```

### Customization
- **Typing Speed**: Adjust in Settings tab (1-1000ms per character)
- **Buffer Time**: Currently hardcoded to 5 minutes in `popup.js` line ~290
- **Check Interval**: Background checks run every 1 second
- **Auto-Delete Frequency**: Checks every minute for timers to delete
- **Testing**: Use browser console (F12) to view logs from all scripts

### Building for Release
- For Chrome Web Store: Zip the files and ensure icons are included
- For Firefox Add-ons: Package as .xpi and submit via Mozilla's Developer Hub
- Update `version` in `manifest.json` for releases
- Ensure all dependencies and permissions are documented

## Troubleshooting

### Timer Not Firing
- Check browser console (F12 > Console) for errors
- Ensure the CSS selector matches exactly (test with `document.querySelector()` in console)
- Verify the element exists when the timer fires
- Check if the page dynamically loads content after initial page load

### Text Not Entering Correctly
- Verify the selector targets an input, textarea, or contenteditable element
- Check typing speed isn't too fast for the page to handle (increase in Settings)
- Ensure the element accepts text input (not disabled or readonly)
- Some frameworks need focus/blur events (ensure enabled in Settings)
- Try increasing post-text-entry delay if page needs time to process

### No Notifications
- Verify browser notification permissions:
  - Chrome: `chrome://settings/content/notifications`
  - Firefox: `about:preferences#privacy`
- Check notification preferences in Settings tab
- Some browsers block notifications in certain contexts

### Storage Issues
- Clear extension data via `chrome://extensions/` or `about:debugging`
- Reload the extension
- Check if browser storage quota is exceeded

### URL Change Issues
- Verify URL behavior setting matches your needs
- Some sites use hash routing (URL changes without page reload)
- Single-page apps may require "Navigate existing tab" option

### Theme Not Applying
- Save settings after changing theme
- Reload the popup window
- Check if system dark mode preference is enabled (for "System" theme)

### Performance Issues
- Use "Compact" view for many timers
- Enable auto-delete to remove old executed timers
- Reduce typing speed if system is slow
- Limit number of concurrent timers

## Privacy & Security

### Data Storage
- All timers and settings stored locally in browser storage
- No data sent to external servers
- Sensitive text is stored unencrypted but masked in UI
- Session-only timers are cleared when tab closes

### Permissions Explained
- **tabs**: Access to tab information for timer execution
- **storage**: Local storage for timers and settings
- **notifications**: Show execution status notifications
- **activeTab**: Interact with active tab content
- **<all_urls>**: Required to inject content scripts on any page

### Security Recommendations
- Use "Mark as sensitive data" for passwords and personal information
- Clear old timers regularly
- Use session-only persistence for sensitive tasks
- Review timers before they execute

## Compatibility

### Browsers
- Chrome 88+
- Microsoft Edge 88+
- Firefox 78+
- Other Chromium-based browsers (Opera, Brave, Vivaldi)

### Manifest Version
- Currently uses Manifest V2 for maximum compatibility
- Manifest V3 migration planned for future releases

### Known Limitations
- Cannot interact with pages requiring authentication to load
- Some dynamic content may load after timer fires
- Shadow DOM elements may not be accessible via standard CSS selectors
- Browser extension pages (chrome://, about:) are not accessible

## FAQ

**Q: Can I schedule multiple actions on different pages?**  
A: Yes! Create separate timers for each page/tab. Each timer is tab-specific.

**Q: What happens if I close the tab before the timer fires?**  
A: Depends on persistence setting. "Session only" cancels, "Tab" and "Browser" persist and can reopen/navigate to the page.

**Q: Can I schedule recurring timers?**  
A: Not currently. Each timer fires once. Create a new timer for recurring tasks.

**Q: How accurate is the timing?**  
A: Very accurate (within 1 second). The 5-minute buffer ensures the page is fully loaded.

**Q: Can I see what text will be entered before it executes?**  
A: Yes, hover over or click the eye icon for sensitive text. Non-sensitive text is shown truncated.

**Q: Does this work on all websites?**  
A: Most websites work, but some with strict CSP policies may block content script injection.

**Q: Can I export/import timer configurations?**  
A: Not in current version. Planned for future release.

**Q: What's the difference between the persistence options?**  
A:
- **Session only**: Timer deleted when tab closes
- **Persist on tab close**: Survives tab close/reload but cleared on browser restart
- **Persist on browser close**: Fully persistent until executed or manually deleted
